   abstract = {A fundamental question of longstanding theoretical interest is to prove the lowest exact count of real additions and multiplications required to compute a power-of-two discrete Fourier transform (DFT). For 35 years the split-radix algorithm held the record by requiring just 4n log 2 n − 6n + 8 arithmetic operations on real numbers for a size-n DFT, and was widely believed to be the best possible. Recent work by Van Buskirk and Lundy demonstrated improvements to the split-radix operation count by using multiplier coefficients or "twiddle factors" that are not n th roots of unity for a size-n DFT. This paper presents a Boolean Satisfiability-based proof of the lowest operation count for certain classes of DFT algorithms. First, we present a novel way to choose new yet valid twiddle factors for the nodes in flowgraphs generated by common power-of-two fast Fourier transform algorithms, FFTs. With this new technique, we can generate a large family of FFTs realizable by a fixed flowgraph. This solution space of FFTs is cast as a Boolean Satisfiability problem, and a modern Satisfiability Modulo Theory solver is applied to search for FFTs requiring the fewest arithmetic operations. Surprisingly, we find that there are FFTs requiring fewer operations than the split-radix even when all twiddle factors are n th roots of unity.},

   abstract = {Digital holography (DH) has emerged as one of the most effective coherent imaging technologies. The technological developments of digital sensors and optical elements have made DH the primary approach in several research fields, from quantitative phase imaging to optical metrology and 3D display technologies, to name a few. Like many other digital imaging techniques, DH must cope with the issue of speckle artifacts, due to the coherent nature of the required light sources. Despite the complexity of the recently proposed de-speckling methods, many have not yet attained the required level of effectiveness. That is, a universal denoising strategy for completely suppressing holographic noise has not yet been established. Thus the removal of speckle noise from holographic images represents a bottleneck for the entire optics and photonics scientific community. This review article provides a broad discussion about the noise issue in DH, with the aim of covering the best-performing noise reduction approaches that have been proposed so far. Quantitative comparisons among these approaches will be presented.},

   abstract = {The thesis investigates the problem of how information contained in multiple, overlapping images of the same scene may be combined to produce images of superior quality. This area, generically titled frame fusion, offers the possibility of reducing noise, extending the field of view, removal of moving objects, removing blur, increasing spatial resolution and improving dynamic range. As such, this research has many applications in fields as diverse as forensic image restoration, computer generated special effects, video image compression, and digital video editing. An essential enabling step prior to performing frame fusion is image registration, by which an accurate estimate of the point-to-point mapping between views is computed. A robust and efficient algorithm is described to automatically register multiple images using only information contained within the images themselves. The accuracy of this method, and the statistical assumptions upon which it relies, are investigated empirically. Two forms of frame-fusion are investigated. The first is image mosaicing, which is the alignment of multiple images into a single composition representing part of a 3D scene. Various methods of presenting the composite image are demonstrated, and in particular, a novel algorithm is developed for automatically choosing an optimal viewing transformation for certain cases. In addition, a new and efficient method is demonstrated for the matching of point features across multiple views. The second frame-fusion method is super-resolution, which aims to restore poor quality video sequences by removing the degradations inherent in the imaging process. The framework presented here uses a generative model of the imaging process, which is discussed in detail and an efficient implementation presented. An algorithm is developed which seeks a maximum likelihood estimate under this model, and the factors affecting its performance are investigated analytically and empirically. The use of "generic" prior image models in a Bayesian framework is described and shown to produce dramatically improved super-resolution results. Finally, super-resolution algorithms are developed which make use of image models which are tuned to specific classes of image. These algorithms are shown to produce results of comparable or better quality than those using generic priors, while having a lower computational complexity. The technique is applied to images of text and faces. Throughout this work, the performance of the algorithms is evaluated using real image sequences. The applications demonstrated include the separation of latent marks from cluttered, non-periodic backgrounds in forensic images; the automatic creation of full 360 • panoramic mosaics; and the super-resolution restoration of various scenes, including text and faces in low-quality video.},

@article{Huang2020,
   abstract = {As acoustic waves are affected by the channel characteristics, such as scattering and reverberation when propagating in water, sonar images often exhibit speckle noise which will cause visual quality of the image to decrease. Therefore, denoising is a crucial preprocessing technique in sonar image applications. However, speckle noise is mainly caused by the sediment echo signals which are related to the background of seafloor sediment and can be obtained by prior modeling. Although deep learning-based denoising algorithms represent a research hotspot now, they are not suitable for such applications due to the high calculation amount and the large requirement of original images considering that sonar is carried by Autonomous Underwater Vehicles (AUVs) for collecting sonar images and performing calculation. In contrast, dictionary learning-based denoising method is more suitable and easier to be modeled. Compared with deep learning, it can greatly reduce the calculation amount and is more easily integrated into AUV systems. In addition, dictionary learning method based on image sparse representation can effectively achieve image denoising similarly. In order to solve the above problems, we propose a new adaptive dictionary learning method based on multi-resolution characteristics, which combines K-SVD dictionary learning with wavelet transform. Our method has the characteristics of dictionary learning and inherits the features of wavelet analysis as well. Compared with several classical methods, the proposed method is better at speckle noise reduction and edge detail preservation. At the same time, the calculation time is greatly reduced and the efficiency is significantly improved.},

   abstract = {Vehicle operations in underwater environments are often compromised by poor visibility conditions. For instance, the perception range of optical devices is heavily constrained in turbid waters, thus complicating navigation and mapping tasks in environments such as harbors, bays, or rivers. A new generation of high-definition forward-looking sonars providing acoustic imagery at high frame rates has recently emerged as a promising alternative for working under these challenging conditions. However, the characteristics of the sonar data introduce difficulties in image registration, a key step in mosaicing and motion estimation applications. In this work, we propose the use of a Fourier-based registration technique capable of handling the low resolution, noise, and artifacts associated with sonar image formation. When compared to a state-of-the art region-based technique, our approach shows superior performance in the alignment of both consecutive and nonconsecutive views as well as higher robustness in featureless environments. The method is used to compute pose constraints between sonar frames that, integrated inside a global alignment framework, enable the rendering of consistent acoustic mosaics with high detail and increased resolution. An extensive experimental section is reported showing results in relevant field applications, such as ship hull inspection and harbor mapping.},

Some key examples comprise the detection, localization and tracking of distinct scene targets, building feature maps, as well as improving positioning accuracy of unmanned submarines by means of image registration and 3D motion estimation to augment traditional positioning devices. This work offers a novel technique for the registration of 2D forward-look sonar images, by optimization over the sonar 3D motion parameters. It incorporates landmark detection through an adaptive clustering scheme with Gaussian map to represent key features at each frame. Improved performance is demonstrated in experiments with real data, both in terms of computation time and accuracy, relative to the state of the art, where the registration utilizes a simplified 2D image transformation model. Among many potentials, the method can improve precision in AUV navigation and environmental modeling.},

Our lightweight mapping approach is based on keyframes and plane-induced homographies between them. We solve the planar reconstruction problem of estimating the keyframe poses with an efficient image rectification algorithm. Camera pose tracking uses continuously extended and refined pla-nar point maps and delivers robustly estimated 6DOF poses. We compare system and method with bundle adjustment and monoc-ular SLAM on synthetic and indoor image sequences. We demonstrate large savings in computational effort compared to the monoc-ular SLAM system while the reduction in accuracy remains acceptable .},
